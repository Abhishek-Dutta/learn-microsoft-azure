## Register for Azure in _TWELVE_ Easy Steps!

This is the UX you should _expect_ when using Azure:

As long as you ***set your expectations*** (_low_) going in you won't be _too_
[**disappointed / frustrated**](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/266794-support-feedback/suggestions/10461873-azure-is-unfinished-product-support-sucks) <br />
With that disclaimer out of the way, let's get started! :-)

### 1. Register for Azure

If you don't _already_ have a Microsoft Azure account
(_why would you?<sup>1</sup>_)
register for one at: https://azure.microsoft.com/

### 2. Yes I want a "Free" Account

Click on `Start Free` button:

P.S: This is a _sign_ of things to come:
_many clicks_ to accomplish simple actions!!!

> Microsoft uses (_very_) "Sticky" Sessions!
Even though I ***signed out*** of my _personal_ (hotmail) account,
they still kept a record on my computer so they would _not_
let me open a new account! hence the incognito browser windows for the
rest of the registration process!

### 3. Click on `Create a New Microsoft Account`

Unless you already have a Microsoft Account and have _never_
used Azure before, you will need to `Create a new Microsoft Account`:

### 4. Input your Desired Email Address

### 5. Fill in "About You" i.e. Personal Details for their Marketing Database!

> Note you will need to use a ***real phone number***
to get your account verified ... see next step!

### 6. Verify your New Account by Phone

![verify-by-phone](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/25849086/e8439490-34b4-11e7-87df-7b9f35e48d76.png)

_Obviously_ you need to use a ***real phone number*** here ...

### 7. Verify your New Account by Credit Card

![credit-card-validation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/25849206/74a9123e-34b5-11e7-8059-ed1de6a63ecb.png)

_Obviously_ this step needs to be a ***real credit card***:
And you should _totally_ Trust Microsoft with your Credit Card,
cause their security is _always_ the best ...

### 8. Check The "Agree" All-the-Things

_Naturally_, the checkbox that lets Microsoft `SPAM` you with their crap
 is checked. It's up to you if you want to drink their coolaid.

Once you click "sign up" go get a coffee because it's _slow_!

### 9. Click `Get started with your Azure subscription`

One more thing to click before you get to see anything useful/relevant:

### 10. Now Sign up to watch a Webinar

Click on the `Get started with your Azure subscription` takes you
to this "Webinar" signup page:

![webinar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/25849876/1f90b362-34b8-11e7-9851-e8bfb1920aa1.png)

Why would I want to waste time on a Webinar?! <br />
Why can't I get started _right now_?!?
_Luckily_ I've used Azure before and I know that clicking the "portal"
link in the Top Navigation will take me to the Azure dashboard.
But if you're `new` to this, you'll have to keep guessing!!

### 11. Click on `Portal` in the Top Nav

When you click on the `portal` link you will be shown the dashboard,
kinda ...

![portal](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/25849959/74f1b176-34b8-11e7-85a8-64d12346a31a.png)

What you are actually shown is a Modal Window!!
One more click before you can get _anything_ done.

### 12. Click on `Maybe Later`

Finally after 12 steps and _reliquishing_ ***all my personal data***
I'm able to see a dashboard:
