# Learn Microsoft Azure

Learn how to deploy your Web Application &amp;
Database Server to Microsoft Azure.

## Why?

The decision was made to deploy your work/app to Azure<sup>1</sup>,
now you have the task of making it happen.

## What?

A Step-by-Step guide to deploying your first app on Microsoft Azure.

> This guide focusses on deploying a Phoenix Web Application
(_because that is our chosen
[technology stack](https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack) @dwyl_)
But it contains many _generally_ applicable skills for other stacks.

## Who?

Developers who need to deploy to Azure
because their client/employer requires them to.

### 0. Go to "Azure Portal Dashboard"

Visit your Azure Dashboard: https://portal.azure.com


### 2. Create a Virtual Machine

1. Click on the "Burger" (โฐ) Menu to expand the service menu
2. Click on "Virtual Machines" in the services menu
3. Click on "+ Add" to add a Virtual Machine

> The Azure Tutorial(s) all assume you have the CLI installed. e.g:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-manage-vm




### 3. Create Ubuntu `16.04 LTS` Virtual Machine

1. Search for "Ubuntu LTS"
2. Select the LTS Version which is _currently_ `16.04 LTS`
3. Select the VM from the Right Menu <br >
  Note: Dependent on your screen size, you may need to scroll to the Right to reveal the "Create" Button.
4. Click "Create" button to start the creation process.

### X. Login With SSH


In our case the user for the server is `hladmin`
and the IP address is `51.140.45.21`.

```
ssh hladmin@51.140.45.21
```


### Upload your Public Key to the VPS

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh hladmin@healthlocker.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com "sudo sshcommand acl-add dokku custom-identifier"

## tl;dr

<sup>1</sup>Microsoft Azure is not "_better_" than any other "Cloud"
Infrastructure/Platform Provider.
They have implemented a IaaS/PaaS in _response_ to Amazon Web Services.
We are _only_ using it because one of our clients (NHS) _requires_ us to.
We would prefer to use AWS, Digital Ocean
or Google Could Platform over Azure _every time_.

We _understand_ from a corporate policy/decision-making perspective
that Azure is an _easy_ decision for certain companies/executives
 to make given their _existing_ investment/commitment to Microsoft ...
 So we want to _document_ our setup so that it can be followed
 by anyone `else` in the same situation.ยง

Much like Windows Phone, Azure is a "_me too_" product where Microsoft
is playing catchup with _well-established/better_
(_more mature, feature rich/innovative, faster, cheaper_) alternatives.
There's _no_ ***technical reason*** why _anyone_ would use Azure
other than a political decision.
In our case the NHS were offered _big_ discounts by Microsoft to use Azure.
Everyone knows that MSFT are discounting Azure to the NHS for reasons
_other_ than "doing good", but the NHS IT people love a bargain so they are
investing huge amounts of time locking themselves into the Microsoft "Cloud".

At least all the apps that _we_ (@dwyl) build are designed to be
"infrastructure agnostic" (_i.e. no "lock-in"_).
